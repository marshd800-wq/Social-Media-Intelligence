# Turn on the live Content-Queue cockpit

The **Score a Draft** page reads your NOVA Content Queue live and can send a draft
forward — once two API tokens are set. Until then it safely shows the baked-in
snapshot. This is a one-time, ~10-minute setup you do in Notion + Vercel.

## 1. Create a Notion integration (gives the read/write token)

1. Go to **notion.so/my-integrations** → **New integration**.
2. Name it e.g. `Pulse Dashboard`. Capabilities: **Read content** + **Update content**.
3. Copy the **Internal Integration Secret** (starts with `ntn_` or `secret_`).
4. Open your **NOVA — Content Queue** database in Notion → **⋯ menu → Connections →
   Connect to → Pulse Dashboard**. (This shares the DB with the integration —
   without it the API returns nothing.)

## 2. Get the Content Queue database id

Open the Content Queue as a full page. The URL looks like:
`notion.so/<workspace>/<32-char-id>?v=...` — the **32-char id before `?v=`** is your
database id. (Our data-source id is `02c8afc9bc4c4ac6ac3e2559d5350ba7`; the code
tries both the data-source and database endpoints, so either id works.)

## 3. Add the two env vars in Vercel

Vercel → project **social-media-intelligence** → **Settings → Environment
Variables** → add (Production + Preview):

| Name | Value |
|---|---|
| `NOTION_TOKEN` | the integration secret from step 1 |
| `NOTION_DATABASE_ID` | the id from step 2 |

Then **redeploy** (Deployments → ⋯ → Redeploy, or just push any commit).

## 4. Done

Reload **Score a Draft**. The idea list badge flips to **● Live from Notion**,
each draft shows a `live` pill, and **Send to NOVA** is enabled — pick a status
(Approve / Schedule / Send for review) + date and it updates the draft's card in
your Content Queue.

---

### What "Send to post" does (and doesn't)
It advances the draft inside **NOVA's own workflow** (sets Status → Approved/
Scheduled and stamps the date, saving your improved caption). It does **not**
auto-publish to Instagram/TikTok, because a real post needs the media asset
(image/reel video) attached — that final hop stays in your existing Metricool
flow. If you later want a true "publish to Metricool" button, that's a follow-up
using a Metricool API token + the media URL.

### Security
Tokens live only in Vercel env vars (server-side). They are never sent to the
browser and never committed to git. The `/api/*` functions read them at runtime.

---

## 5. (Phase 2) Make NOVA the source of truth for Targets / Matrix / SOPs

The **Engagement Targets**, **Content Matrix**, and **SOPs** views read live from
Notion via `/api/config`. Each block is independent and **degrades to the baked-in
fallback** if its database id isn't set — so you can wire them one at a time.

**These databases are already built and seeded for you** (under **NOVA OS**):

| Database | What to do | Database id (for env var) |
|---|---|---|
| **NOVA — Engagement Targets** | already seeded (TikTok 3–9, IG 4, LinkedIn 2) | `6c26d46e55ae49e190d7517b5364ec2c` |
| **NOVA — SOPs** | already seeded (3 starter SOPs) | `a0912f362f344be28e7ac09e76f0fe4d` |
| **NOVA — Content Queue** | `Character` + `Job` columns already added | reuses `NOTION_DATABASE_ID` |

To turn them on, two steps:

1. **Connect the `Pulse Dashboard` integration to the two new databases.** Open
   each (**NOVA — Engagement Targets**, **NOVA — SOPs**) → **⋯ → Connections →
   Connect to → Pulse Dashboard**. (Same integration from step 1 above. Without
   this the API can't read them — this is the one manual click I can't do for you.)
2. **Add two env vars in Vercel** (Production + Preview), then redeploy:

   | Name | Value |
   |---|---|
   | `NOTION_TARGETS_DB` | `6c26d46e55ae49e190d7517b5364ec2c` |
   | `NOTION_SOPS_DB` | `a0912f362f344be28e7ac09e76f0fe4d` |

**Content Matrix** needs no env var — it reads the Content Queue live via
`/api/drafts` (`NOTION_DATABASE_ID`). Tag posts with **Character** (one or more of
REALTOR®, Entrepreneur, Soft Luxury Experience Curator, Atlanta Native) and **Job**
(Entertain / Educate / Encourage); the matrix tallies coverage and each cell
drills down to its ideas. Optional Queue fields enrich the drill-down (all already
added to the Queue): **Series / Lane** (powers the filter), **Disposition**
(Keep / Off-brand (rework) / Repurpose / Retire → color chips), **Perf Score** and
**Brand Score** (numbers). Empty is fine — the view degrades gracefully.

The three views flip from "awaiting live data" to live within ~60s (responses are
edge-cached 60s to stay well under Notion's rate limit). Analytics (reach, ER,
themes) intentionally stay on the weekly Metricool bake — Notion only serves the
small, hand-edited config you own.

| Env var | Powers | If unset |
|---|---|---|
| `NOTION_TARGETS_DB` | Engagement Targets numbers | shows unverified fallback benchmarks |
| `NOTION_SOPS_DB` | SOPs view | shows "connect the SOPs database" |
| (reuses `NOTION_DATABASE_ID`) | Matrix coverage counts | cells show "awaiting live data" |
